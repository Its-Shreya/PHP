## Introduction

This repository provides simple PHP code examples to help you get started with PHP development. The examples included are meant to illustrate basic concepts and are not intended for production use. They should serve as a foundation upon which you can build more complex applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic-php-codes.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd basic-php-codes
   ```
   
3. **Set Up a Local PHP Server**:
   If you have PHP installed locally, you can use PHPâ€™s built-in server to run the examples. For example:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Open Your Browser**:
   Go to `http://localhost:8000` to view the PHP code examples.

## Code Examples

### Hello World

**File:** `hello_world.php`

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

This simple script outputs "Hello, World!" to the browser.

### Variables and Data Types

**File:** `variables.php`

```php
<?php
$integer = 42;
$float = 3.14;
$string = "Hello, PHP!";
$boolean = true;

echo "Integer: $integer <br>";
echo "Float: $float <br>";
echo "String: $string <br>";
echo "Boolean: " . ($boolean ? 'true' : 'false') . "<br>";
?>
```

This example demonstrates basic PHP data types and how to use them.

### Control Structures

**File:** `control_structures.php`

```php
<?php
$number = 10;

// If-Else Statement
if ($number > 0) {
    echo "Number is positive <br>";
} else {
    echo "Number is zero or negative <br>";
}

// For Loop
for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
    echo "Iteration: $i <br>";
}
?>
```

This script shows how to use if-else statements and loops in PHP.

### Functions

**File:** `functions.php`

```php
<?php
function greet($name) {
    return "Hello, $name!";
}

echo greet("Alice") . "<br>";
echo greet("Bob") . "<br>";
?>
```

Learn how to define and call functions in PHP.

### Forms and User Input

**File:** `form.php`

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<form method="post" action="process_form.php">
  Name: <input type="text" name="name">
  <input type="submit">
</form>

</body>
</html>
```

**File:** `process_form.php`

```php
<?php
$name = htmlspecialchars($_POST['name']);
echo "Hello, $name!";
?>
```

This example demonstrates handling form data with PHP.

## Usage
